Recruitment and Selection
===========================

'Description': Recruitment provides opportunities to departments to align staff 
skill sets to initiatives and goals, and for departmental and individual growth.
Proper planning and evaluation of the need will lead to hiring the right person
for the role and team. The process can lead to frustration, if there are not
proper resources or if the resources are not properly utilized due to the
obsolete methods in the process. This project tries to overcome the problems
in hiring process.

Persona:
=========
Prescreened Prospective Hires:
===============================
John Brown is the Assistant Manager of Human resources in a government agency.John
and his team have to select a pool of 20 candidates for a special category of
employees (say R) every three months. This project will minimize the time
duration of selection process by generating a pool of prescreened candidates
before getting the notification from the agency for the next class.

''Details'':
The HR team is given a target of new hires for different categories. This
project explains recruitment process of one such class of employees (say R)
and the problems encountered in the hiring process. The recruitment for class
R consists of various steps. Examination, Technical Efficiency Test, Background
checks and negotiation for salary (salary belonging to that class is fixed).
For a candidate to get hired, he must have all the tests cleared in order to be
eligible for the final list. John wants to generate a pool of prescreened
employees on the basis of eligibility criteria before his team gets notified.
Once he has a filtered list of employees, it will be easier for them to achieve
the target from filtered employees at the time of notification.

Goals:
This template will overcome the delays caused in achieving the target in the
deadline provided by preparing the pool of prescreened perspective new hires
before the recruitment starts for the next target.

Problem Scenarios:
===================
HR team is provided a target of 20 new hires for class R. The process involves
selecting the employees from the Exam list on the basis of their score. The
passing score for the exam is 70.  After the selection from exam list,
candidates are required to pass technical efficiency exam. By meeting all these
criteria, they are moved to the next step of background checks where the
education and experience are verified. After that the negotiations for the
salary are done. 
The frustrating part arrives when the background checks are failed and the
negotiations are not successful and the target is short. The process is
repeated again to fill the vacant positions, while the candidates passing the
criteria are still waiting for remaining people to be selected resulting the
delay in the overall process. The process that should have finished in the fourth
day after the notification, takes another two days to get finished, because of
the shortage of filtered employees.

User Stories:
=============
John and his team prepares for the next class of 20 employees.  The date of
notification for next class is approaching.  The screening starts and 40
candidates are selected. After filtering the employees for examination and
technical exam, background checks are performed. Filtered candidates move to
negotiations and final list of candidates is generated. This list is being
finalized and sorted in order of the exam score of candidates.  With the
prescreened pool of employees, things came easy and processing is done in time.
